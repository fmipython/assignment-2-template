Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.
Annihilate?
No.
No violence.
I won't stand for it.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.
Annihilate?
No.
No violence.
I won't stand for it.
Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!

You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; 
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. 
Bow ties are cool!
Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
I hate yogurt.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.
Annihilate?
No.
No violence.
I won't stand for it.
Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!
I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!
No, I'll fix it.
I'm good at fixing rot.
Call me the Rotmeister.
No, I'm the Doctor.
Don't call me the Rotmeister.
Heh-haa!
Super squeaky bum time!
I hate yogurt.
It's just stuff with bits in.
Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm the Doctor.
Well, they call me the Doctor.
I don't know why.
I call me the Doctor too.
I still don't know why.
You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; 
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. 
Bow ties are cool!
Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
I hate yogurt.
It's just stuff with bits in.
They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

I call me the Doctor too.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.
Annihilate?
No.
No violence.
I won't stand for it.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; 
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. 
Bow ties are cool!
Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
I hate yogurt.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

Annihilate?
No.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.
Annihilate?
No.
No violence.
I won't stand for it.
Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!
I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!
No, I'll fix it.
I'm good at fixing rot.
Call me the Rotmeister.
No, I'm the Doctor.
Don't call me the Rotmeister.
Heh-haa!
Super squeaky bum time!
I hate yogurt.
It's just stuff with bits in.

I don't know why.
I call me the Doctor too.

You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; 
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. 
Bow ties are cool!
Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
I hate yogurt.
It's just stuff with bits in.
They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.
And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.
Annihilate?
You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?
No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

No.
No violence.
I won't stand for it.
Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!
I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!
No, I'll fix it.
I'm good at fixing rot.
Call me the Rotmeister.
No, I'm the Doctor.
Don't call me the Rotmeister.
Heh-haa!
Super squeaky bum time!
I hate yogurt.
It's just stuff with bits in.

I call me the Doctor too.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; 
I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. 
Bow ties are cool!
Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
I hate yogurt.
It's just stuff with bits in.
They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
